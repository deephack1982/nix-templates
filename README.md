# Deephack's Nix templates

Repository with flakes for each of the projects types that I commonly work with. Good starting point for a project of any of these types.

## Usage

```bash
nix flake init --template github:deephack1982/nix-templates#PROJECTTYPE
```
Where PROJECTTYPE is one of the subdirectories in the repo.
